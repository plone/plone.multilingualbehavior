Changelog
=========

1.2.3 (2019-12-27)
------------------

- Made the ``__name__`` method of the handler a property.
  Otherwise you get a very weird name with 'bound method' in it.
  [maurits]


1.2.2 (2019-12-24)
------------------

- Add uninstall step.
  [bsuttor]

- ``__name__`` method is added for preventing bug when you try to go in Components
  tab into ZMI (/manage_components) or when you try to make a snapshot.
  [bsuttor]

- Add uninstall profile.
  [bsuttor]


1.2.1 (2014-05-23)
------------------

- Use the more specific IEditFinishedEvent rather than IObjectModifiedEvent
  for copying over language independent fields, since IObjectModifiedEvent
  can be thrown multiple times, causing a performace lag [pysailor]

1.2 - 2013-09-24
----------------

- Check property ``bypass_languageindependent_field_permission_check`` exists
  in registry to allow usage with lrf-branch.  [saily]

- Rewrite ``handle_modified`` subscriber to notify ObjectModifiedEvent,
  and pass canonical object as event-description. This replaces the non-working
  semaphore.  Fixes #65
  [saily]

- Switch to a cloned user with a global Editor role to allow synchronization
  of language independant fields of other object (which the current user could
  not have permission to) when modifying an object.  Fixes #66
  [saily]

- We may need to know the language from a object that is not ITranslatable
  [ramon]
